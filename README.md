# GarbageGo-
A smart garbage collection app prototype:
Waste disposal is a very tedious process. In order to improve and promote segregated waste disposal, our application creates a necessary intermediary between a customer and a vendor in need for a particular waste. We provide a waste pickup system that eases the process of both waste disposal and collection. 
The application works on a simple membership basis which connects the customer to all the nearby vendors for waste disposal.
Through the application the user can segregate and dispose waste on the basis of its types such as organic waste, e waste etc.
The user is incentivised with a small reward system that promotes the use of this application.
This also makes it convenient for the vendors to find customers with the help of this network.
